Ghosting Inn 

Ghosting Inn is a short student project focus on creating a narrative focused game. This demo is a 7-8 minute demo that was made in a three month period using Unity, mixing both 2D assets with 3D environments.
Game overview: 

Players embark on a narrative mystery adventure game that focuses on player exploration and conversation with characters. Also mix in with puzzle challenges that involve the collaboration between the player character Corinne and friendly ghost Flute. As Corinne can interact both with the living world and the roaming ghosts, while Flute has the ability to manipulate electronic devices. And as the story unravels, so does the small interpersonal story of the two playable characters, as Corinne is looking forward to quitting their job at the Cedar Creek Inn and trying to find a healthy balance from their stressful life.
Design Goals:

The goal for the building had 2 areas of exploration which are the inside Cedar Creek Inn main building and the outside area. I focus on making the mystery story section short, only having a single puzzle of using Flute abilities and Corinne talking to a ghost NPC who can give information about the vengeful ghost past.
