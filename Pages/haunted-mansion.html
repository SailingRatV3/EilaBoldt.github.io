Haunted Mansion Level

The level is a 3D Unreal first-person horror level set in a large mansion the player wakes up in, an seemingly normal mansion that slowly changes and shifts into an enclosed mansion that is entrapping the player into an enclosed space. Players would find an outside patio garden to see a fountain that has a puzzle mechanic of rotating disks on a pedestal. By this time the player would return to the mansion to see the mansion has changed, as hallways are now blocked off and the player must follow marking that trail to a dark spooky side of the mansion. The player would memorize the painting solution to solve the fountain puzzle to pick up a key to the locked door, which the house now tries to encase on the player. Once the player gets to the locked door to find an empty room only has the door close behind the player, ending the game.
Level Design Goals

For this level I focus on designing a first person horror game that relies on puzzle mechanics and event systems. The level takes place in a shifting mansion that is slowly closing off the player path. The mansion feel lived in, as there are times the player can hear someone moving upstairs, humming quietly in the background, and walking behind the player. But the shrinking space would feel that reality is something of a nightmare and that there is no escape from the encreepness walls. 

               

 In building the whitebox and the papermap, I focused on building player tension to make  player unease of the changing environments. I want the design of the level to be unsettling in suspense without having to use an enemy or monster to provide a horror experience.   
Puzzle Design

In designing the puzzle, I want to focus on using the level environment to guide the players in finding the solution. Within the level, the player is introduce to a puzzle where the player must rotate 3 dials to the correct rotation. 

The player will be encourage to explore as the mansion has shifted around them as the explore the deepest part of the mansion to find the mansion slowly decaying. Player would find a framed photograph of the correct dial rotation that the player must memorize to correct rotate to the correct rotation to open drain the fountain water.   

I did this project in both creating and learning in making an event system on Unreal. The challenge part is how to have the events play in timing with player actions and movements. 

During this level playtesting, players would have different experiences and interactions that would vary depending on long the player encountered a puzzle and how would the player notice the change in the mansion. As some players would play this level withing five minutes, while some could explore every inch of the level.
